# Tasks

**Task 0: Installation and Hardware Testing**  
This task involved installation of software for (i) microcontroller programming and (ii) simulation. The hardware provided to us was tested using the installed software. 

**Task 1: Sensing**  
In this task, we had to accurately measure the tilt angle using sensors like accelerometer, gyroscope or a combination of both. For this, we had to study the datasheets of sensors and understand I2C communication protocol for reading the data from the sensors. We also had to visualize the sensor data in Scilab using XBee wireless module. 

**Task 2: Construction and Simulation**  
This was one of the important tasks, where we had to analyse the design of our Balance Bot. We  also had to simulate the Balance Bot model in Scilab for understanding the system dynamics. 

**Task 3: Controller Design**  
After interfacing sensors and constructing the bot, we had to design the brain of the bot. In this task, we had to write code for PID control for balancing the bot. We also had to come up with control architectures -- simple feedback, cascade or feed-forward control -- for efficient balancing. 

**Task-4: Theme Implementation**  
In this task, we had to navigate the Balance Bot in the arena. Arena consisted of various paths and hurdles (humps and slopes). For navigating the bot we designed a joystick for wireless control of the bot.
