# Balance Bot

A two-wheel self-balancing robot, based on the ATmega2560 micro-controller, which uses a Cascaded PID control architecture. Four PID controllers are implemented to control the position, velocity, rotation (measured using Quadrature Encoders) and the tilt angle (measured using GY80 Sensor) of the robot.
